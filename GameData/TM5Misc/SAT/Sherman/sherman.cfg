	description = The Sherman tank was the main tank used by the Americans and other allied forces during WWII and was used all the way up to the Korean War. While the German tanks were better armored and more powerful they were eventually overwhelmed by the shear number of tanks that the US produced for the war. Also has an attach node on top for attaching a machine gun. *hint hint, m2, hint hint*
