	description = The F-14A entered service with the United States Navy in 1973 powered by Pratt & Whitney TF30s. By the end of the decade, following numerous problems with the original engine, the DoD began procuring the upgraded TF30-P-414As. While these engines solved the serviceability problems, the fuel consumption and thrust was comparable to the initial modelâ€“considerably less than what the F-14 had been designed for. In 1979, a derivative of the GE F101 turbofan called the F101-X was selected to power the F-14 and was later designated the F110-GE-400. The primary difference between the F110-GE-400 and the F110-GE-100 is length - the F110-GE-400 has a 50-inch (1.3 m) tailpipe extension to suit the F-14 airframe, which is fitted downstream of the augmentor (afterburner section). The F110-GE-400 engine produced 23,400 lbf (104 kN) of thrust with afterburner at sea level, which rose to 30,200 lbf (134 kN) at Mach 0.9.[3] This provided a significant increase over the TF30's maximum thrust of 20,900 lbf (93 kN).[4] These upgraded jets were known as F-14Bs, as were production aircraft powered by the F110. The same engine also powers the final variant of the aircraft, the F-14D.
