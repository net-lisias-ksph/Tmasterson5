	description = The United States Navy, United States Coast Guard, and United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration employ hull numbers in conjunction with a hull classification symbol to uniquely identify vessels and to aid identification. A particular combination of hull classification and hull number is never reused and therefore provides a means to uniquely identify a particular ship. For example, there have been at least eight vessels named USS Enterprise, but CV-6 uniquely identifies the World War II aircraft carrier from all others. For convenience, the combined designation, which is painted on the sides of the hulls, is frequently called the "hull number". The official Navy Style Guide says that hull numbers do not include hyphens. The U.S. Navy sometimes ignores the sequence of hull numbering. For example, the Navy built the last Los Angeles-class nuclear submarine as SSN 773. Next the Navy built the three Seawolf class submarines SSN 21 through SSN 23. Then the Navy later resumed the original sequence of hull numbers with the USS Virginia SSN 774 for its next class of nuclear attack submarines.
