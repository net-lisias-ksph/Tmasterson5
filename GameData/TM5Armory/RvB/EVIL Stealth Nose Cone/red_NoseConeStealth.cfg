	description = Not nearly as aerodynamic as other pointy objects, this nose cone is shaped to harmlessly reflect radar waves in safe directions so you can surprise your enemy - because NOBODY expects the Kerbal Inquisition! Amongst our weaponry are such diverse elements as: fear, surprise, ruthless efficiency, and nice red uniforms! Ha!
