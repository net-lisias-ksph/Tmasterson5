	manufacturer = Kerbal Dynamics
	description = A specially designed dual missile rail rack for use in our line of weapons bays. It is much better than a DER because it launches the missile downwards rather than into the side of the bay. Because launching missiles into the sides of weapons bays is bad. Or so our lawyers say.
