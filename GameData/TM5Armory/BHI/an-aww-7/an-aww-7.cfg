	description = The AN/AWW-7 Data Link Pod weapon control data link allows the operator to select an aimpoint for weapon impact, and provides the only currently available link between munition seekers and humans. This link generally requires electro-optical/infrared acquisition in clear weather. AGM-84E SLAM uses the Harpoon airframe, engine and warhead with an AGM-65D Maverick IIR seeker and an AGM-62 Walleye AN/AWW-14 video datalink pod to enable the aircrew to control the seeker.
