	description = The AN/AWG-9 radar is an all-weather, multi-mode X band pulse-Doppler radar system used in the F-14 Tomcat. It is a very long-range air-to-air system with the capability of guiding several AIM-54 Phoenix or AIM-120 AMRAAM missiles at the same time using its track while scan mode. The AWG-9 was the result of a series of Navy programs to build what was known as a "fleet-defense fighter"; an aircraft armed with extremely long-range radars and missiles that would be able to engage formations of enemy aircraft well-away from aircraft carriers.
