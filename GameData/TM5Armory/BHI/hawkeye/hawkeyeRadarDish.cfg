	description = The APS-145 Advanced Airborne Surveillance Radar is the most reliable, cost effective, high power radar available. This sophisticated system is the latest in a long line of airborne early warning systems from Lockheed Martin. Its predecessors make the Northrop Grumman E-2C Hawkeye the most reliable carrier-based aircraft in the world.  The APS-145 is a high-power UHF Doppler radar. It utilizes a rotating antenna within a circular radome mounted atop the aircraft to simultaneously detect and track multiple threats on the sea, in the air, over land, and the critical land-sea interface. While its primary platform is the E-2C, it is easily adaptable to other aircraft, including the Lockheed Martin C-130 and P-3.
