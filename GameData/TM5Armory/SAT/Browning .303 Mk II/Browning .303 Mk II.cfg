	description = The Browning 0.303in Mark II was the standard gun used in the gun turrets on most British bombers during the Second World War. It was essentially the 1930 Pattern belt-fed Colt-Browning machine gun with a few minor modifications for British use. The gun was selected after competitive tests in 1934. BSA and Vickers were both given a license to produce the gun, and by the outbreak of war production was running flat out.
